# Example-.csv-input-files--AIDrugApp-v1.2

Example files contains three files that includes features/ descriptor values of ligands or molecular compounds as following:
1. For Regression:- Input .csv file for building machine learning models based on regression Auto-Multi-ML algorithms
2. For Classification:- Input .csv file for building machine learning models based on claassification Auto-Multi-ML algorithms
3. For Prediction:- Input .csv file (based on feature engineered model) for predicting target data by applying user specific ML models (recommended best performing ML models)

Note: 
1. Information regarding molecular descriptors can be found here https://github.com/DivyaKarade/Example-.csv-input-batch-file 
2. Users can input any number of features per molecule for feature engineering and for building ML models.
